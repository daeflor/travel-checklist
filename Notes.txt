Upcoming To-Do List:
- Clean up and move the row creation logic
- Save to storage whenever the input elements trigger onchange or oninput (text and number inputs respectively)
- Load from storage whenever the page loads

Thoughts:

- Add clear buttons to each column to clear all entries at once. (Could be good while on trips). 
- Buttons to increment and decrement quantity count
- Quantity counters may not need to be 'input' elements. (Contingent on increment/decrement buttons & UX).
- Could change text input element to a textarea with modified css
- Rename 'packed' to luggage?
- Maybe it's more user-friendly to not default quantities to zero
- Is there a type of logging to console that only triggers in a specific mode?
- Rename checklist.js
- Currently loading from storage just appends to the grid, it doesn't remove anything currently in it. This seems fine.

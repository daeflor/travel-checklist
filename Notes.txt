TO-DOs:

	- index.html      : 0
	- GridManager.js  : 17
    - Grid.js         : 3
    - Header.js       : 4
    - ListToggle.js   : 4
    - Row.js          : 1
    - Helpers.js      : 6
	- style_new.css   : 2

Upcoming To-Do List:
- BUG: Changing a modifier closes the popup
- Start with simple checklist (don't need differentiation between 'needed' and 'in cart')
- Need to clearly differentiate between item categories and packed categories (or whatever the term ends up as)
- Hit area for 'categories/grid' button is not big enough (should be entire area/div, not just around the text). 
- At some point, need to handle the case when there are no existing lists. What does the list of lists looks like? Is there an Add Row button?
- The Toggle for the List of Lists could be the old dropdown header, or a SWITCH icon next to it. 
    And the list of lists could show up in the area where the normal rows are. (e.g. active grid gets hidden, list of list gets displayed)
- Make it pretty and user friendly
- Add support for deleting lists


Thoughts:

- !Add state sorting
- Is there a reason for not using shared storage?
- Is it good that the quantity popups close after you add or subtract one time?
- Freeze top/header row of the different lists
- To be consistent, maybe have a 'go' button in the list of lists which opens the list, since selecting the list to open it isn't consistent with the rest of the app
- Create 'move' buttons to move an item up or down the grid/list
    Grid state would need to be stored when Rows get moved up or down in the grid
- Use MusicExtension's ExportLocalStorageToFile method, as a backup in case localstorage gets erased. 
    (Does this even work on phone? Should I pull the code out from either project and create a separate library file?)
- Standardize between " and '
- Should have a good way to test backwards compatibility
- Figure out what's causing poor performance with collapsible settings view
- Is it possible in a clean way to make the quantity popover behavior different on pc (for development) than on mobile 
- A row could have a notion of 'balance' (instead) of state. Balance is determined by quantity amounts, and dictates the color-coding of the row. 
- Make this work for a shopping list
- Perhaps split up header and/or headermanager into its own thing
- Should long item names be truncated?
- There should be no hardcoded lists in index.html
- Should get away from concept of grid, rows, and columns, since they are not being used that way exactly
  //ListManager (All Lists)
        //  Headers
        //  List
        //    -> Header
        //    Items
        //      "Columns"/QuantityTrackers/Checkbox  
        // ?

Future:

- Ability to sort by state (e.g. 'Completed' items at the bottom of the list).
    Should have items/rows have a state, which dictates their color, rather than just keep track of the color. 
- Is there a type of logging to console that only triggers in a specific mode?
- Could group similar item types into categories, which show up in dropdown lists of the category
    Main problem with this is then each dropdown item would also have its own popover, which could get very cluttered
- Could there be icons for item names (or item categories) instead of text?
- Somehow enable offline functionality. (Currently, the page does not work properly if there is no network connection).
    Reminder: There is an uncompressed and compressed version of jquery. Post-development, should use compressed.
    Reminder: Should probably get latest versions of plugins (e.g. Popper.js).
    Reminder: Should figure out which exact subset of files is necessary (specifically for font-awesome)
        - Could also consider using a different font library, if not going to be using CDN anyway.
- Could have a separate/hidden section for feedback after a trip. For example, quantity of an item not actually used, and length of the trip. 
- Replace any jquery with pure javascript where possible (currently there is nothing that can be easily replaced).
- Categories Improvements:
    - Have ability for user to add/edit/remove categories
    - One of the categories could be travel preparation, which would require different columns and interactions
    - The links to different categories could have checkmarks or be color-coded to indicate whether or not that section is 'complete' or not
        May also make sense to have an 'overview' section/page for this, which tallies totals and shows overall state
- Would be nice if buttons changed color or something when pressed
    This might not be necessary for mobile
- Could use objects/properties (e.g. { ... }) for certain function parameters (e.g. NewRow) instead of many different individual parameters
- Need a manager for the whole page, not just grids. Could split up GridManager or rename it. 
    (Could depend on whether or not Interactions get pulled out into a separate manager/file)
- Color palette of popovers (incl. background) could be better
- Might be useful to have a helper function which turns elements into html tags
- Could alternate row background color for better readability
- Ability to collapse all 'completed' item rows so you can focus just on the incomplete ones?

    - - - Total             : 110

Upcoming To-Do List:
- Maybe ViewListener should be separated from the rest of the View, instead of ViewRenderer (since ViewListener is what would need to be replaced during test scenarios)
    - Or have a 3rd file/class that manages/tracks View state
- Whenever there is an urge to use console.log to debug something, try a different approach instead.
- Make the Auth screen and UI prettier
- Clean up mess in AppController from recent commit(s).
- Revamp CreateNewElement
    - This will facilitate use of Google Font Material Icons
- Start using replaceState or pushState in more cases within AppNavigationController
- Merge debug section into 'New' row 
    - This might not work with the new landing/loading screen/page
- Backup or cloud storage functionality
- Look into (unit) testing possibilities 
- Remove loading of any firebase scripts that aren't actually needed
- Address miscellaneous todos
- Replace var with const and let
    - Replace with some lets with consts
- Every time an unreported error is hit, add error handling for it
- Consider filing bugs in a dedicated location, to avoid bogging up the code with comments that may potentially not even need to be addressed in some cases (i.e. not all issues necessarily need to get fixed in the foreseeable future).
- Quantity popovers could be to the right of the toggles. The inc/decrement buttons within the popover could be aligned vertically instead of horizontally, and they could use up/down arrow/triangle icons instead of +/-.
    - Could also consider using collapsibles or some other method for this, instead of Bootstrap Popovers
- Look over https://www.toptal.com/javascript/10-most-common-javascript-mistakes

Features:
- ! Some way to clear everything across Lists, and to clear everything across Lists except for the 'Needed' columns
- A bar at the bottom of the list screen that tells you if there are any orange/incomplete items remaining (so that you don't need to scroll)
- Shopping List: Start with simple checklist (don't need differentiation between 'needed' and 'in cart')
- Could have a travel preparation category/section (i.e. a Pre-Travel 'To-Do' list) as part of the Travel Checklist, which would require different columns and interactions
- Ability to sort by state (e.g. 'Completed' items at the bottom of the list).
- Consider using MusicExtension's ExportLocalStorageToFile method, as a backup in case localstorage gets erased. 
    - Would need an import option for this to be useful. Could possibly have an option to load a list from a specific folder which is part of the project, and in which exports have been manually placed. 
    - (Does this even work on phone? Should I pull the code out from either project and create a separate library/utility file?)
    - Could also consider the possibility of uploading the data to Google Drive or something similar (as an extra challenge / learning experience)
- Somehow enable offline functionality. (Currently, the page does not work properly if there is no network connection).
    Reminder: There is an uncompressed and compressed version of jquery. Post-development, should use compressed.
    Reminder: Should probably get latest versions of plugins (e.g. Popper.js).
    Reminder: Should figure out which exact subset of files is necessary (specifically for font-awesome)
        - Could also consider using a different font library, if not going to be using CDN anyway.
- Does it make sense to have a 'Car' or 'Other' column in the Travel Checklist
- Make columns modular, so that they can be added or removed by the user, and the user can choose what icon to use for them (and therefore choose the category).
- Could have a dark mode toggle

Usability & Appearance (UX & UI):
- It would be nice to have some sort of animation feedback when trying to scroll up when already at the top of a list
- Make the Progressive Web App prettier with an icon and other things
- May want to change back the Add New Item Row to being left-aligned with a light background again
- May want to change back to having the List Toggle open a List, and a settings button to open the Settings View
- When focus is brought to a text area, it would be nice to scroll to it. (i.e. when tapping in a text area in Settings View, it doesn't always scroll into view above the keyboard, currently)
- Color palette of popovers (incl. background) could be better

Code Cleanup:
- Consider replacing (some) callbacks with async/await
- It may be possible to avoid the Active List/SettingsView/Popover/etc. by using self-invoking functions (IIFEs)
- All instances of document.getElementById should be replaced with a custom one that includes error handling
- View.cs is pretty long and could possibly be broken up, perhaps between HomeScreenView and ListScreenView, or something alone those lines.
- Would it help to use listId as prefix in listItemId? (e.g. xxx.yyy)
    - This might be nice, because then only one param would need to be passed when editing the model (or at least one fewer)
- Consider other options for Storage, such as IndexedDB or LocalForage
- Consider having two separate websites for travel and shopping lists, since they aren't directly related. They can still share some common utility files. 
- Would it help to use data-* attributes instead of Element IDs?
- Consider removing reliance on Popovers (popper.js) and re-create this functionality myself in vanilla JavaScript and CSS
- There are probably some GetElementByID calls that could be called on other elements instead of the document
- Standardize bracket/spacing/parameter/callback usage and format
- In the future, calls to the View may need to be a callback passed to the model (e.g. if it interacts with Storage), but for now it isn't necessary
- Would it help to remove eventlisteners that aren't being used?
- List & List Item might not be the best terms to use, since a list toggle is sort of a list item...
- Standardize between " and '
- Could use objects/properties (e.g. { ... }) for certain function parameters (e.g. NewRow) instead of many different individual parameters
    - But for functions that always require exact parameters, maybe should just have them explicitly stated instead of passing a single object
    - Either way, error handling at the beginning of functions is probably the best route, to ensure that any expected parameters are defined.
- Should get away from concept of grid, rows, and columns, since they are not being used that way exactly
- Might be useful to have a helper function which turns elements into html tags
- Replace any jquery with pure javascript where possible (currently there is nothing that can be easily replaced).
- Could use _ and $ to organize functions/methods

Testing, Debug Tools, & Performance:
- Add error handling at the beginning of functions to ensure any required parameters are provided.
- Find some way to force the PWA to update to the latest version 
    - USB Debugging is the best current solution for this
- Should have a good way to test backwards compatibility (assuming backwards compatibility support still exists and is desired)
- Figure out what's causing poor performance with collapsible settings view
- Debug mode could also dictate storage location, among other things

Security:
- Make git repo private once not using GitHub Pages
- Restrict by IP / Domain, and limit write access. (Probably want to do this if using Firebase)

Brainstorming & Ideas for the Future:
- Could have an 'overview' section/page, which tallies totals and shows overall state/balance of Lists
- Could group similar item types into categories, which show up in dropdown lists of the category
    Main problem with this is then each dropdown item would also have its own popover, which could get very cluttered
- Could there be icons for item names (or item categories) instead of text?
- Could have a separate/hidden section for feedback after a trip. For example, quantity of an item not actually used, and length of the trip. 
- Could alternate row background color for better readability
- Ability to collapse all 'completed' item rows so you can focus just on the incomplete ones?
- A feature that guesses clothing quantities based on the number of nights provided.

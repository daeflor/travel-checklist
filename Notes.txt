TO-DOs:

	- index.html      : 0
	- GridManager.js  : 4
    - Grid.js         : 1
    - Row.js          : 1
    - Helpers.js      : 2
	- Style.css       : 2

Upcoming To-Do List:
- Choose icon for Clear button
- Visual improvements (including element alignment)
    Could look into gradient colors
- Need to clearly differentiate between item categories and packed categories (or whatever the term ends up as)

Thoughts:

- Add 'clear' buttons to each column to clear all entries at once. (Could be good while on trips). 
    These could be in popovers. Should standardize popover creation logic
- Use MusicExtension's ExportLocalStorageToFile method, as a backup in case localstorage gets erased. 
    (Does this even work on phone? Should I pull the code out from either project and create a separate library file?)
- Standardize between " and '
- Could alternate row background color for better readability
- Because of margins, the columns in the header row are not aligned with columns of the item rows.
- Could be useful to have a helper function which turns elements into html tags

Future:

- Ability to sort by state (e.g. 'Completed' items at the bottom of the list).
    Should have items/rows have a state, which dictates their color, rather than just keep track of the color. 
- Item Name could be a dropdown, and when you click on it you can change the name and it also reveals other options, like deleting the row or moving it up or down in the grid.
- Create 'move' buttons to move an item up or down the grid/list
    Grid state would need to be stored when Rows get moved up or down in the grid
- Is there a type of logging to console that only triggers in a specific mode?
- Could group similar item types into categories, which show up in dropdown lists of the category
    Main problem with this is then each dropdown item would also have its own popover, which could get very cluttered
- Could there be icons for item names (or item categories) instead of text?
- Somehow enable offline functionality. (Currently, the page does not work properly if there is no network connection).
    Reminder: There is an uncompressed and compressed version of jquery. Post-development, should use compressed.
    Reminder: Should probably get latest versions of plugins (e.g. Popper.js).
    Reminder: Should figure out which exact subset of files is necessary (specifically for font-awesome)
        - Could also consider using a different font library, if not going to be using CDN anyway.
- Could have a separate/hidden section for feedback after a trip. For example, quantity of an item not actually used, and length of the trip. 
- Replace any jquery with pure javascript where possible (currently there is nothing that can be easily replaced).
- Categories Improvements:
    - Have ability for user to add/edit/remove categories
    - One of the categories could be travel preparation, which would require different columns and interactions
    - The links to different categories could have checkmarks or be color-coded to indicate whether or not that section is 'complete' or not
        May also make sense to have an 'overview' section/page for this, which tallies totals and shows overall state
- Would be nice if buttons changed color or something when pressed
    This might not be necessary for mobile
- Could use objects/properties (e.g. { ... }) for certain function parameters (e.g. NewRow) instead of many different individual parameters
- Need a manager for the whole page, not just grids. Could split up GridManager or rename it. 
    (Could depend on whether or not Interactions get pulled out into a separate manager/file)
- Color palette of popovers (incl. background) could be better

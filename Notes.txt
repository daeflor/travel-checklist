    - Utilities.js          : 0
    - - - Total             : 76

Upcoming To-Do List:
- Look into consolidating StorageManager functions (e.g. findInStorage)
- Could consider changing UI/DOM structure so that different screens are handled together (e.g. All Home Screen elements in one div, all List screen elements in another, instead of Headers together in their own div. And then, similar elements like headers would still share a class).
- Every time an unreported error is hit, add error handling for it
- All EventListeners should be moved to View
- Look into IIFEs vs ActivePopover and ActiveSettings, etc.
- To Switch row pos: Model/Storage: for i = 0 ... if (id == id) ... var x = list[i+1], lists[i+1] = lists[i], lists[i] = x ...
    View: param: id, prevId ... GetElement(id).remove() ... insertBefore(GetELement(prevId), GetElement(id));

Features:
- Shopping List: Start with simple checklist (don't need differentiation between 'needed' and 'in cart')
- Could add the Pre-Travel 'To-Do' list to the Travel Checklist
- Ability to move items up or down in a list. Create 'move' buttons to move an item up or down the grid/list
    - Grid state would need to be stored when Rows get moved up or down in the grid
- Ability to sort by state (e.g. 'Completed' items at the bottom of the list).
    Should have items/rows have a state, which dictates their color, rather than just keep track of the color. 
- The links to different categories could have checkmarks or be color-coded to indicate whether or not that section is 'complete' or not
    May also make sense to have an 'overview' section/page for this, which tallies totals and shows overall state
- Consider using MusicExtension's ExportLocalStorageToFile method, as a backup in case localstorage gets erased. 
    - Would need an import option for this to be useful. Could possibly have an option to load a list from a specific folder which is part of the project, and in which exports have been manually placed. 
    - (Does this even work on phone? Should I pull the code out from either project and create a separate library/utility file?)
    - Could also consider the possibility of uploading the data to Google Drive or something similar (as an extra challenge / learning experience)
- Somehow enable offline functionality. (Currently, the page does not work properly if there is no network connection).
    Reminder: There is an uncompressed and compressed version of jquery. Post-development, should use compressed.
    Reminder: Should probably get latest versions of plugins (e.g. Popper.js).
    Reminder: Should figure out which exact subset of files is necessary (specifically for font-awesome)
        - Could also consider using a different font library, if not going to be using CDN anyway.
- Could have a travel preparation category/section, which would require different columns and interactions

Usability & Appearance (UX & UI):
- It would be nice to have some sort of animation feedback when trying to scroll up when already at the top of a list
- Make the Progressive Web App prettier with an icon and other things
- Is it possible to make the Android Back button work in the app (e.g. to go back to the Home Screen from the List Screen)?
    Might require having the different screens (e.g. Home vs List) actually use different pages hashes (e.g. travel-checklist/#/List)
- May want to change back the Add New Item Row to being left-aligned with a light background again
- May want to change back to having the List Toggle open a List, and a settings button to open the Settings View
- When focus is brought to a text area, it would be nice to scroll to it. (i.e. when tapping in a text area in Settings View, it doesn't always scroll into view above the keyboard, currently)
- Color palette of popovers (incl. background) could be better

Code Cleanup:
- Would it help to use listId as prefix in listItemId? (e.g. xxx.yyy)
- Consider other options for Storage, such as IndexedDB or LocalForage
- Consider having two separate websites for travel and shopping lists, since they aren't directly related. They can still share some common utility files. 
- Would it help to use data-* attributes instead of Element IDs?
- Consider removing reliance on Popovers (popper.js) and re-create this functionality myself in JavaScript and CSS
- There are probably some GetElementByID calls that could be called on other elements instead of the document
- Standardize bracket/spacing/parameter/callback usage and format
- In the future, calls to the View may need to be a callback passed to the model (e.g. if it interacts with Storage), but for now it isn't necessary
- It might be nice if List Item IDs were prefixed by the List ID, so only one param would need to be passed when editing the model
- It may be possible to avoid the Active List/SettingsView/Popover/etc. by using self-invoking functions
- Would it help to remove eventlisteners that aren't being used?
- List & List Item might not be the best terms to use, since a list toggle is sort of a list item...
- Standardize between " and '
- Could use objects/properties (e.g. { ... }) for certain function parameters (e.g. NewRow) instead of many different individual parameters
    But for functions that always require exact parameters, maybe should just have them explicitly stated instead of passing a single object
- Should get away from concept of grid, rows, and columns, since they are not being used that way exactly
- Might be useful to have a helper function which turns elements into html tags
- Need a manager for the whole page, not just grids. For example, app.js. 
- Replace any jquery with pure javascript where possible (currently there is nothing that can be easily replaced).
- Could use _ and $ to organize functions/methods

Testing, Debug Tools, & Performance:
- Should have a good way to test backwards compatibility
- Figure out what's causing poor performance with collapsible settings view
- Debug mode could also dictate storage location, among other things

Brainstorming & Ideas for the Future:
- Could group similar item types into categories, which show up in dropdown lists of the category
    Main problem with this is then each dropdown item would also have its own popover, which could get very cluttered
- Could there be icons for item names (or item categories) instead of text?
- Could have a separate/hidden section for feedback after a trip. For example, quantity of an item not actually used, and length of the trip. 
- Could alternate row background color for better readability
- Ability to collapse all 'completed' item rows so you can focus just on the incomplete ones?
